## Problem definition
One of the biggest threats to modern civilisation is the danger of droughts. Future generations will face the consequences of climate change with uninhabitable areas on the globe. When we were growing up, if you left the tap running while brushing your teeth, you were harming the climate. Today, that awareness has changed to saving carbon emissions. We want to provide a platform that informs citizens about their water consumption in the context of the city's water supply and helps them make sustainable decisions in their daily lives.

## Project description
With our **Blue Budget** app we want to make it possible for the user to get a picture of his daily water budget and what he consumes in reality. We have listed several water consumers of daily live and show the user their real consumption.
Depending of your munich postal code you get your individual water budget. Influenced by weather data like temperature and rainfall percipitation of the past **Blue Budget** predicts your daily limit for the upcoming days. 
Additionally we predict the groundwaterlevel of your postal code using machine learning and show the user a weather forecast. Using this data, the user can now change his behaviour, saving water, when groundwater levels are low, and be less savy when they are high.

## Goal
Make the citizens more aware of their water consumption and lead to a more considerate use of water as a valuable resource!

## Challenges
- Data acquisistion
- Data accessibility
- Integrating frontend and backend

## What's next
- Improve waterbudget calculation 
- more fine-grained breakdown of tasks consuming water, requiring more research and data sources on finer granularity
